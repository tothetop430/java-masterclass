# java-masterclass

If you are a beginner to Java programming or in general a beginner in computer science, then [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/) course is for you.

It took me around 2 months to complete this 80hrs+ long course that offers in-depth working knowledge of how to use Java Programming Language in different scenarios.

If you believe in certificates, then you can view my course completion certificate [here](https://ude.my/UC-ccf17ffd-6482-4759-83f9-968c641ff53e)
